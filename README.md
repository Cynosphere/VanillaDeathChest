# VanillaDeathChest
Takes the gravestone from OpenBlocks and replaces it with a vanilla chest.

I take zero credit for this mod. I took most of the code from OpenBlocks, and I'll be happy to take this mod down if the OpenMods Team wants me to.

Set the gamerule "dontSpawnDeathChests" to true to disable death chest spawning.
