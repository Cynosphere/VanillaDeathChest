# VanillaDeathChest
Takes the gravestone from OpenBlocks and replaces it with a vanilla chest.

I take zero credit for this mod. I adapted 90% of the code from OpenBlocks, and I'll be happy to take this mod down if the OpenMods Team wants me to.

Set the gamerule "spawnDeathChests" to false to disable death chest spawning.

I made this mod for u/Lou_Dude929 on Reddit because he wanted to run a vanilla server with a gravestone mod.
