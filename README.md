# VanillaDeathChest

Takes the gravestone from OpenBlocks and replaces it with a vanilla chest.

A lot of the code was taken and adapted from OpenBlocks.

Set the gamerule "spawnDeathChests" to false to disable death chest spawning.

I made this mod for u/Lou_Dude929 on Reddit because he wanted to run a server with a gravestone mod
that vanilla clients could connect to.
